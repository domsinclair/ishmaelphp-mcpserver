# Feature Packs

Feature Packs are standalone, reusable modules that add capabilities to an IshmaelPHP application without bloating the framework core. They are distributed as Composer packages and/or templates and follow the Ishmael module discovery conventions.

What you’ll find here:
- Why Feature Packs
- Structure and conventions
- Installation models (auto-discovery vs. publish via CLI)
- Versioning and support
- Authoring guidance and examples
